    <h4>Happy Valentines Day!</h4>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-size: 14px;">Today is a special day to celebrate love, and I want you to know how much you mean to me. You are one of the kindest
    people I’ve ever known, even if you don’t believe it. Your heart is so pure, and your kindness has made my life so much
    better. You are also the sweetest person I’ve met—your care and warmth always make me feel safe and happy. You may not
    like sweets, but to me, you’re even sweeter than them. I love how thoughtful you are, always putting others before
    yourself. But please remember to take care of yourself too because you deserve the same love you give. You’re also so
    responsible, managing your family, school, and church with so much strength. I admire you for it, but don’t forget to
    rest—I’ll always be here to help you through it all. And to me, you are truly beautiful—inside and out. No matter how
    much you deny it, you are perfect just the way you are.
    
    Most of all, I’m so happy to have you in my life. Since the day I met you, I haven’t regretted a single moment. You are
    a blessing, and I feel truly lucky to share this day, and every day, with you. Happy Valentine’s to you, Angela, and I
    hope we get to enjoy many more days of love together in the future. So please, enjoy today without any stress—just love,
    joy, and happiness. I love you so much, Angela—always and forever.</p>


        </body>
